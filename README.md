# Mphil-Project---Average-Controllability

#Dataset
MEA recording analysis of cellular networks average controllability (and graph theoretical metrics)(SAND lab, Cambridge). 
For spike detection and functional connectivity analysis, code and relevant functions are abailable at: 
> Spike detection and average controllability detection: 'spikes'
> Post-stimulation analysis: 'stim_script_ms' & 'MEA_heatmap_MK'
> Artefact removal: 'remove_Artefact'

#Analysis
All analysis is completed in MATLAB R2021b. 

#Disclaimer
Not all packages are necessary, some may be outdated in future analyses, and no seed is set within any script so results may vary.
